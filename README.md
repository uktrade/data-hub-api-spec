# Data Hub API Spec
Swagger files and test server for the Data Hub CRM project

- [Interactive Swagger-UI documentation](/docs)
- [Raw YAML API spec](/datahub.yml)

To Build
* `npm install && npm build`
* The output file - `datahub.yml` - is the full spec
* `npm generate-node` runs a local version of swagger-ui with mocked endpoints at http://localhost:8080
* `npm generate-client` makes a Python client for the API

Both the generate commands require a working Java installation
